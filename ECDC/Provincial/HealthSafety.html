            <h4>For example:</h4>
            <p>
                Have I alerted others in the building that there’s a fire?
            </p>
            <p>
                Has someone called the fire department?
            </p>
            <p>
                Am I physically able to use a fire extinguisher?
            </p>
            <p>
                Is the fire small and contained in a single object (like a pan or a waste basket)?
            </p>
            <p>
                Am I safe from the fire’s toxic smoke?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do I have a clear escape route?
            </p>
            <p>
                Use a fire extinguisher when all of these questions are answered “yes.” If you’re unsure about whether or not it’s safe to use a fire extinguisher, and for all other situations, alert others, leave the building, and call 911 from a mobile or neighbor’s phone. It is not recommended that children use fire extinguishers.

            <h4>WHAT IS A FIRT AID KIT USED FOR?</h4>
            <h6>Treating injuries & Kit Fill List</h6>
            <p>A first aid kit is a box, bag or pack that holds supplies used to treat minor injuries including cuts, scrapes, burns, bruises, and sprains. More elaborate first aid kits can also include survival supplies, life-saving emergency supplies or convenience items like bug sting wipes or cold & flu medicines. </p>
            <p>Individuals who want to prepare for medical emergencies or if they have an injury will want to have the appropriate first aid supplies ready to use. The purpose of this article is to give you an idea of the types of injuries to prepare for and a list of the supplies used for each injury. There is a supply list for basic first aid kits that can be used for the injuries described. As always, when possible, seek medical attention for any serious injuries.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4 class="text-center">EXAMPLES OF INJURIES AND WHAT FIRST AID SUPPLIES TO USE</h4>
            <h6 class="text-center">Trauma Injuries</h6>
            <p><b>Gunshot Wound - </b>Pressure bandages, compressed gauze tourniquets, and latex free gloves are used to control bleeding. Stop the bleed packs contain both of these life-saving first aid products.</p>
            <p><b>Severed / Crushed limb - </b>Tourniquet to stop hemorrhage/blood-loss </p>
            <p><b>Deep wound - </b>Compressed gauze, abdominal dressing, compress bandage or blood stopping bandages are all used for deep wounds where pressure should be applied to control bleeding and keep out contamination from the wound.</p>
            <p><b>2nd & 3rd degree burns - </b>Sterile water, water based gels saturated gauze and sterile gauze dressings are all used to help treat serious burns. They cool the skin, help reduce potential infection and in some cases relieve pain caused by burns. </p>
            <p><b>Broken Bone - </b>Triangular bandage, splinting material, elastic bandages and first aid tape are all used to help treat a broken bone. For compound fractures where the bone is broken through the skin, sterile gauze, bandages for absorbing blood and even compress dressings can be used. This type of injury should be seen by emergency medical professionals immediately.</p>

            <h6 class="text-center">Minor Injuries</h6>
            <p><b>Cuts & Scrapes – </b>Adhesive bandages, butterfly bandages, antiseptics, gauze pads, first aid tape, and gauze rolls are all used to treat minor cuts and scrapes.</p>
            <p><b>Minor Burns - </b>Burn sprays and  water-based burn gels  are used to help relieve pain and treat the burn. Try and avoid oils, butter or any petroleum-based ointments for minor burns. </p>
            <p><b>Minor Eye Irritations - </b>Sterile eye irrigation solutions (eye wash) are used to rinse the eye from dust or dirt that may be irritating the eye. Simply use a single use bottle of eyewash and or an eye cup to rinse the eye. </p>
            <p><b>Sprains & Strains - </b>A twisted ankle, sprained finger or wrist will require an instant cold pack to help reduce swelling and pain. Some injuries will require wrapping or splinting which involve the use of elastic compression type products and splinting material like tongue depressors or an aluminum, moldable splint.</p>
            <p><b>Eye injuries - </b>A trained medical professional should see any injury to the eye. Often eye pads are used to keep the eye closed and or protect it from further injury. Do not try and remove any foreign object by yourself. Further injury to the eye could take place. </p>

            <h6 class="text-center">Skin Care Related Injuries</h6>
            <p>Typical skin related ailments include sunburn, poison ivy, hives caused by allergic reactions and insect stings. Most of these are easily treated by the use of over the counter ointments. Burn gel is helpful for minor sunburn, while poison ivy can be treated with special medicated washed and creams. Bug bites are usually harmless and can be treated with bug wipes or an antihistamine like Benadryl. A doctor should see serious reactions that restrict breathing or involve swelling. </p>
